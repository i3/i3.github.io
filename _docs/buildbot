The i3 buildbot setup
=====================
Michael Stapelberg <michael@i3wm.org>
September 2012

This document explains the http://www.buildbot.net/[buildbot] setup we use to
provide up-to-date documentation and debian packages at http://build.i3wm.org/.
We publish these information so that our setup is well-documented (thus
decreasing future maintenance effort) and because it might be interesting for
other projects.

== Introduction

What we are doing in i3 is called Continuous Integration (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration): we publish the changes we
make on our local machines as often as possible. In order to maintain a
continuously high quality, each time any developer pushes changes to the
official git repository, a number of quality assurance tools start running
automatically:

1. Latest documentation is generated and provided at
   http://build.i3wm.org/docs/. This makes it easy to link to documentation for
   features which are only in the current git version, not in the released
   version.
2. The source code is compiled and it is automatically posted to the IRC
   channel whether there were any compiler warnings. While developers should
   notice compiler warnings, this mechanism creates a bit of public pressure
   ("Oh, Michael introduced warnings with this commit!"). More importantly,
   since this mechanism builds a dist tarball and then compiles that tarball,
   any changes to the source which would result in an uncompilable dist tarball
   are immediately obvious. Therefore, we could cut a release from the current
   git version at any point in time.
3. The clang static analyzer runs and the resulting report is provided at
   http://build.i3wm.org/clang-analyze/. While every developer needs to compile
   his code before committing, he doesn’t necessarily use clang (so we catch
   build failures when using clang) and he also probably doesn’t run a static
   analyzer as part of his normal workflow. By just being available without any
   friction, this mechanism encourages developers to look at the report and fix
   problems.
4. Debian (and Ubuntu) packages are built. This not only ensures that we don’t
   change anything in the source code which would lead to an FTBFS (Fails To
   Build From Source) when building a Debian package, it also goes a long way
   to encourage end users to test i3. To remove the need and resource
   requirements for them to compile their own version of i3 regularly, we
   provide packages that integrate conveniently with a normal Debian system
   (e.g. that are automatically upgraded).

== Why buildbot?

Previously, I was unsatisfied with the current state of FOSS CI tools like
Jenkins, Tinderbox and others. They either seemed bloated, hard to use,
outdated or unappealing for some other reason.

Then I discovered buildbot and was impressed by its flexibility. It let me
implement everything I wanted from a CI tool and (in my opinion) it is
light-weight, easy to deploy and well maintained.

The only downside of buildbot is its configuration and documentation: You need
to spend quite a bit of time (I needed multiple days) until it works the way
you want it to and oftentimes, the documentation is far too sparse. This is one
of the reasons why I’m publishing the i3 setup.

== Configuration

See the next section for a complete, copy & pasteable configuration file. This
section covers the most important aspects without covering every line.

This document assumes you are running buildbot 0.8.6p1.

=== Change sources

Since i3 uses a central git repository, we use the official buildbot
https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/blob/master/master/contrib/git_buildbot.py[git
post-receive hook] that sends the change information to the buildbot master.

=== Schedulers

There are two things (called "builders" in buildbot-language) which happen
whenever a new change in the +next+ branch of i3 occurs:

1. The "docs" builder builds and uploads the latest documentation. This happens
   directly from the git repository with a custom asciidoc configuration which
   indicates that these docs refer to the git version. Therefore, this builder
   does not benefit from having a dist tarball available (contrary to the other
   builders).

2. The "dist" builder prepares a dist tarball and then triggers the remaining
   builders. This ensures that building the dist tarball (an operation which
   takes about one minute due to documentation generation) only happens once.

Here is the relevant configuration part:

*Schedulers*:
---------------------------------------------
c['schedulers'] = []

c['schedulers'].append(SingleBranchScheduler(
    name = 'dist',
    branch = 'next',
    treeStableTimer = 10,
    builderNames = [ 'dist', 'docs' ],
))

c['schedulers'].append(Triggerable(
    name = 'dist-tarball-done',
    builderNames = [ 'compile', 'clang-analyze', 'debian-packages', 'ubuntu-packages' ],
))
---------------------------------------------

=== Building the dist tarball

This builder clones the i3 git repository and runs "make dist", which creates a
tarball that could be named "i3-4.2.tar.bz2" for example. This tarball is then
renamed to dist-%(gitversion).tar.bz2 (so that we can work with a predictable
name in the next steps) and uploaded to the buildbot master (since we can have
multiple buildslaves, we cannot just let it rest on the buildslave that built
it). Afterwards, old dist tarballs are cleaned up and the remaining builders
are triggered:

*Building a dist tarball*:
---------------------------------------------
factories = {}

f = factories['dist'] = BuildFactory()

# Check out the git repository.
f.addStep(s_git)

# Fill the 'gitversion' property with the output of git describe --tags.
f.addStep(shell.SetProperty(command = 'git describe --tags', property = 'gitversion'))

# Build the dist tarball.
cmd(f, name = 'make dist', command = [ 'make', 'dist' ])

# Rename the created tarball to a well-known name.
cmd(f,
    name = 'rename tarball',
    command = WithProperties('mv *.tar.bz2 dist-%(gitversion)s.tar.bz2'),
)

# Upload the dist tarball to the master (other factories download it later).
f.addStep(transfer.FileUpload(
    slavesrc = WithProperties('dist-%(gitversion)s.tar.bz2'),
    masterdest = WithProperties('distballs/dist-%(gitversion)s.tar.bz2'),
))

# Cleanup old dist tarballs (everything older than tree days).
f.addStep(master.MasterShellCommand(
    command = "find distballs -mtime +3 -exec rm '{}' \;",
    name = 'cleanup old dist tarballs',
))

# Everything worked fine, now trigger compilation.
f.addStep(Trigger(
    schedulerNames = [ 'dist-tarball-done' ],
    copy_properties = [ 'gitversion' ],
))
---------------------------------------------

Three things are noteworthy about this part of the configuration:

1. For convenience, we call each factory +f+ (just like the global buildbot
   config uses +c+ for the top-level configuration) and add it to a dictionary.
   Factories in that dictionary are later automatically configured for each
   buildslave.

2. We have a shared step called +s_git+ so that we only have one location in
   the configuration file where we specify the git repository URL and branch.

3. We have a custom function called +cmd+ which is a shortcut for defining a
   +ShellCommand+ with +haltOnFailure=True+ (since each step is critical) and
   +logEnviron=False+ (for brevity).

Here are their definitions:

*cmd*:
---------------------------------------------
def cmd(factory, **kwargs):
    factory.addStep(ShellCommand(
        haltOnFailure = True,
        logEnviron = False,
        **kwargs
    ))
---------------------------------------------

*s_git*:
---------------------------------------------
s_git = Git(
    repourl = 'git://code.i3wm.org/i3',
    branch = 'next',

    # Check out the latest revision, not the one which caused this build.
    alwaysUseLatest = True,

    # We cannot use shallow because it breaks git describe --tags.
    shallow = False,

    # Delete remnants of previous builds.
    mode = 'full',

    # Store checkouts in source/ and copy them over to build/ to save
    # bandwidth.
    method = 'copy',
)
---------------------------------------------

=== Compiling the dist tarball

For this builder to work, you obviously need to install all the
build-dependencies for your software on each buildslave. In the case of i3,
this can be done with +apt-get build-dep i3-wm+.

The compilation is pretty straight-forward since it uses the builtin +Compile+
step. We call +make+ with +-j4+ (we don’t have enough buildslaves to make
figuring out the amount of cores at build-time worthwhile) and +DEBUG=0+ to
simulate release build conditions. Also, we pass the preprocessor flag
+-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2+ and the compiler flags +-Wformat+ and +-Wformat-security+
to enable additional warnings.

*Compiling the dist tarball*:
---------------------------------------------
f = factories['compile'] = BuildFactory()
unpack_dist_tarball(f)
f.addStep(Compile(
    command = [ 'make', 'DEBUG=0', '-j4' ],
    warningPattern = '.*warning: ',
    warnOnWarnings = True,
    workdir = 'build/DIST',
    env = {
      'CPPFLAGS': '-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2',
      'CFLAGS': '-Wformat -Wformat-security'
    },
))

f.addStep(WarningsToIRC())
---------------------------------------------

Again, we use custom functions (and a custom buildstep) to make our lives
easier. Here is the definition of unpack_dist_tarball which adds three steps to
the factory that download and unpack the dist tarball to the +DIST/+ directory:

*unpack_dist_tarball*:
---------------------------------------------
def unpack_dist_tarball(factory):
    factory.addStep(transfer.FileDownload(
        mastersrc = WithProperties('distballs/dist-%(gitversion)s.tar.bz2'),
        slavedest = 'dist.tar.bz2',
    ))

    factory.addStep(slave.MakeDirectory(dir = 'build/DIST'))

    cmd(factory,
        name = 'unpack dist tarball',
        command = [ 'tar', 'xf', 'dist.tar.bz2', '-C', 'DIST', '--strip-components=1' ],
    )
---------------------------------------------

The +WarningsToIRC+ build step is a custom build step which sets a property
called "ircsuffix" that is used by our custom IRC bot. This is covered later in
more detail. This property gets set to a green or red message, depending on
whether there were any warnings:

*WarningsToIRC*:
---------------------------------------------
class WarningsToIRC(buildstep.BuildStep):
    def start(self):
        warnings = self.getProperty("warnings-count")
        if warnings is not None and int(warnings) > 0:
            warnings = int(warnings)  # just to be sure
            self.setProperty("ircsuffix", ("\0037 with %d warning%s!" %
	        (warnings, "s" if warnings != 1 else "")))
        else:
            self.setProperty("ircsuffix", "\0033 without warnings")
        self.finished(SUCCESS)
---------------------------------------------

=== Static code analysis

For this builder to work, you additionally need the +clang+ compiler on each
buildslave: +apt-get install clang+.

This builder uses only custom functions which you already know by now. It runs
scan-build, then moves scan-build’s output from a date-based directory directly
into the +CLANG/+ directory and uploads that to the buildmaster.

On the buildmaster, a webserver is configured which has a symlink to
+/home/build/i3-master/htdocs/clang-analyze+ in its document root.

*static code analysis*:
---------------------------------------------
f = factories['clang-analyze'] = BuildFactory()
unpack_dist_tarball(f)
cmd(f,
    name='analyze',
    command = [
        'scan-build',
        '-o', '../CLANG',
        '--html-title', WithProperties('Analysis of i3 v%(gitversion)s'),
        'make', '-j8',
    ],
    workdir = 'build/DIST',
)

# remove the subdirectory -- we always want to overwrite
cmd(f, command = 'mv CLANG/*/* CLANG/')

f.addStep(transfer.DirectoryUpload(
    slavesrc = 'CLANG',
    masterdest = 'htdocs/clang-analyze',
    compress = 'bz2',
    name = 'upload output',
))

f.addStep(ClangToIRC())
---------------------------------------------

The +ClangToIRC+ custom step is even simpler than +WarningsToIRC+. It simply
sets the ircsuffix property to a static message:

*ClangToIRC*:
---------------------------------------------
class ClangToIRC(buildstep.BuildStep):
    def start(self):
        self.setProperty("ircsuffix", ", see http://build.i3wm.org/clang-analyze/")
        self.finished(SUCCESS)
---------------------------------------------

=== Generating documentation

This builder is the one which is the least clean of all. It uses the Debian
packaging information to decide which docs to publish and which manpages to
generate. Additionally, it uses a for loop instead of calling a script. I
recommend including a script to do this in your repository instead.

Apart from these concerns, the builder is straight-forward: It clones the git
repository, generates the documentation and then uploads the documentation to
the buildmaster:

*Generating documentation*:
---------------------------------------------
f = factories['docs'] = BuildFactory()
f.addStep(s_git)
# Fill the 'gitversion' property with the output of git describe --tags.
f.addStep(shell.SetProperty(command = 'git describe --tags', property = 'gitversion'))
cmd(f, name = 'build docs', command = [ 'make', '-C', 'docs', "ASCIIDOC=asciidoc -a linkcss -a stylesdir=http://i3wm.org/css -a scriptsdir=http://i3wm.org/js --backend=xhtml11 -f docs/asciidoc-git.conf" ])
cmd(f, name = 'build manpages', command = "for file in $(sed 's/\.1$/.man/g' debian/i3-wm.manpages); do asciidoc -a linkcss -a stylesdir=http://i3wm.org/css -a scriptsdir=http://i3wm.org/js --backend=xhtml11 -f docs/asciidoc-git.conf \"$file\"; done")
f.addStep(slave.MakeDirectory(dir='build/COPY-DOCS'))
cmd(f, name = 'copy docs', command = "cp $(tr '\\n' ' ' < debian/i3-wm.docs) COPY-DOCS")
cmd(f, name = 'copy manpages', command = "cp $(sed 's/\.1$/.html/g' debian/i3-wm.manpages | tr '\\n' ' ') COPY-DOCS")

f.addStep(transfer.DirectoryUpload(
    slavesrc = 'COPY-DOCS',
    masterdest = 'htdocs/docs-git',
    compress = 'bz2',
    name = 'upload docs'))

f.addStep(DocsToIRC())
---------------------------------------------

Just as +ClangToIRC+, +DocsToIRC+ appends a static message:

*DocsToIRC*:
---------------------------------------------
class DocsToIRC(buildstep.BuildStep):
    def start(self):
        self.setProperty("ircsuffix", ", see http://build.i3wm.org/docs/")
        self.finished(SUCCESS)
---------------------------------------------

=== Building Debian/Ubuntu packages

This is the most complex builder of all. It uses +pbuilder-dist+, +debchange+,
+dpkg-buildpackage+ and +reprepro+ to generate a Debian repository with a
cleanly compiled package for amd64 and i386. In order for it to work, you need
to install the following packages: +apt-get install devscripts dpkg-dev
reprepro ubuntu-dev-tools pbuilder+. Afterwards, you need to allow the user as
which the buildslave runs to execute pbuilder via sudo without needing a
password, so add a config file like this one:

*sudoers.d*:
---------------------------------------------
echo 'build    ALL= NOPASSWD: SETENV: /usr/sbin/pbuilder' > /etc/sudoers.d/build
---------------------------------------------

Then, as the user as which your buildslave runs, setup the pbuilder
environments (you only need to do this once):

*pbuilder preparation*:
---------------------------------------------
sudo ln -s pbuilder-dist /usr/bin/pbuilder-sid-amd64
sudo ln -s pbuilder-dist /usr/bin/pbuilder-sid-i386
pbuilder-sid-amd64 create
pbuilder-sid-i386 create
---------------------------------------------

Also, you will need a GPG key to sign these packages.

The debian builder starts by unpacking the dist tarball, copying the Debian
packaging from git, creating an empty Debian repository with the
+i3-autobuild-keyring+ contents in it. It then adds a new changelog entry to
reflect the git version and the fact that this package was built automatically,
builds a source package with +dpkg-buildpackage+ and adds it to the repository.
Afterwards, it updates each pbuilder and builds binary packages for each
architecture (amd64 and i386). After adding the resulting packages to the
repository, it uploads the repository to the buildmaster:

*Debian builder*:
---------------------------------------------
distributions = [ 'sid-amd64', 'sid-i386' ]
gpg_key = 'BE1DB1F1'

f = factories['debian-packages'] = BuildFactory()
# We need the git repository for the Debian packaging.
f.addStep(s_git)
unpack_dist_tarball(f)
cmd(f, name = 'copy packaging', command = "cp -r debian DIST/")

# Add a new changelog entry to have the git version in the package version.
cmd(f,
    name = 'update changelog',
    workdir = 'build/DIST',
    command = [ 'debchange', '-m', '-l', WithProperties('+g%(gitversion)s'), 'Automatically built' ],
)

cmd(f,
    name = 'source pkg',
    command = [ 'dpkg-buildpackage', '-S', '-us', '-uc' ],
    workdir = 'build/DIST',
)

for dist in distributions:
    f.addStep(slave.MakeDirectory(dir = 'build/RESULT-' + dist))

# Create debian sid repository
f.addStep(slave.MakeDirectory(dir = 'build/REPO-sid/conf'))
f.addStep(transfer.StringDownload(
    """Codename: sid
Suite: unstable
Architectures: i386 amd64 source
Components: main
DebIndices: Packages Release . .gz .bz2
DscIndices: Sources Release . .gz .bz2
SignWith: %(gpg_key)s
""" % { "gpg_key": gpg_key },
    slavedest = 'REPO-sid/conf/distributions',
))

# add source package to repository
reprepro_include(f, 'i3-wm*_source.changes', 'dsc')

# Add keyring to the repository. We need to run git clone on our own because
# the Git() step assumes there’s precisely one repository we want to deal with.
# No big deal since the i3-autobuild-keyring repository is not big.
cmd(f,
    name = 'clone keyring repo',
    command = 'git clone git://code.i3wm.org/i3-autobuild-keyring',
)
reprepro_include(f, 'i3-autobuild-keyring/prebuilt/*.changes')

for dist in distributions:
    # update the pbuilder
    cmd(f, name = 'update builder', command = 'pbuilder-' + dist + ' update')

    # build the package for each dist
    f.addStep(ShellCommand(
        logEnviron = False,
        name = 'pkg ' + dist,
        command = 'pbuilder-' + dist + ' build --binary-arch \
--buildresult RESULT-' + dist + ' --debbuildopts -j8 i3-wm*dsc',
        warnOnFailure = True
    ))

    reprepro_include(f, 'RESULT-' + dist + '/*.changes')

# upload the sid repo
# Since the next step is cleaning up old files, we set haltOnFailure=True -- we
# prefer providing old packages over providing no packages at all :).
for directory in [ 'pool', 'dists' ]:
    f.addStep(transfer.DirectoryUpload(
        slavesrc = 'REPO-sid/' + directory,
        masterdest = 'htdocs/debian/sid/' + directory,
        compress = 'bz2',
        name = 'upload sid ' + directory,
        haltOnFailure = True,
    ))

f.addStep(master.MasterShellCommand(
    command = "find htdocs/debian/sid/pool -mtime +3 -exec rm '{}' \;",
    name = 'cleanup old packages',
))

# We ensure there is an empty i18n/Index to speed up apt (so that it does not
# try to download Translation-*)
f.addStep(master.MasterShellCommand(
    command = [ 'mkdir', '-p', 'htdocs/debian/sid/dists/sid/main/i18n' ],
    name = 'create i18n folder',
))
f.addStep(master.MasterShellCommand(
    command = [ 'touch', 'htdocs/debian/sid/dists/sid/main/i18n/Index' ],
    name = 'touch i18n/Index',
))
---------------------------------------------

The +reprepro_include+ command is defined as follows:

*reprepro_include*:
---------------------------------------------
def reprepro_include(factory, path, debtype='deb', **kwargs):
    cmd(factory,
        name = 'reprepro include',
        command = 'reprepro --ignore=wrongdistribution -T ' + debtype + ' -b REPO-sid include sid ' + path,
        **kwargs
    )
---------------------------------------------

Running such a builder for Ubuntu works exactly the same way, but you need to
replace "sid" with "precise" in all places (see the full configuration file for
an example).

=== Status targets

We don’t advertise the HTTP status target. Instead, status is posted to IRC via
a custom bot. This bot provides an HTTP end point and buildbot is configured to
push status changes to that endpoint:

*http status target*:
---------------------------------------------
c['status'].append(buildbot.status.status_push.HttpStatusPush(
    serverUrl = 'http://localhost:8080/push_buildbot',
))
---------------------------------------------

You can find the source code of that bot at
http://code.stapelberg.de/git/go-buildbot-announce/. As the name suggests, it
is written in Go. Also, it is quite specific to i3, so you might be better off
implementing such a bot (or plugin) on your own. It might make for a nice
example, though, especially back when its only feature was announcing the build
status:

http://code.stapelberg.de/git/go-buildbot-announce/tree/src/i3build.go?id=eeebf1a546454c8a0d82ca623886bb835cd32ba0

=== Creating the buildslave

One more thing to note is that when creating the buildslave, you should use the
+--umask+ argument to configure the umask for all generated files:

*Creating the buildslave*:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
buildslave create-slave --umask=022 i3-buildslave buildbot.i3wm.org build-1 <password>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Full configuration file

This is the full configuration file, as tested and currently in use (except for
the passwords, though):
