== You can show everybody your appreciation for i3wm by wearing our t-shirt

The i3wm team is collaborating with a shirt manufacturer in Germany
that provides high quality t-shirts with a cool i3wm logo.

Since the website is in German only, we want to help with your order
in case that German is not your primary language.
