Debian and Ubuntu repositories
==============================

== When should you use our repositories?

In general, you should use the repositories of your distribution. Adding
third-party repositories to your +/etc/sources.list+ has security implications
and makes your +apt-get update+ take longer.

If you are using Debian stable::
    The latest version of i3 will be in Debian testing quite soon. The version
    in Debian stable can be old, however (we cannot update it after stable has
    been released). The best way is to add Debian testing and tell +apt+ to
    prefer Debian stable. You should *not* use our repository.
    Alternatively, you can also use
    link:http://backports.debian.org/[stable-backports (e.g. wheezy-backports for
    Debian wheezy)].
If you are using Ubuntu::
    Only a handful of packages are maintained by Ubuntu developers. The rest is
    synchronized periodically from Debian, every 6 months. Therefore, Ubuntu
    often includes old versions of i3. You should use our Ubuntu repository.

== Ubuntu repository

=== Stable releases

This Ubuntu repository is provided by sur5r and contains the latest stable
release of i3. To use it, run the following commands:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ /usr/lib/apt/apt-helper download-file https://debian.sur5r.net/i3/pool/main/s/sur5r-keyring/sur5r-keyring_2025.03.09_all.deb keyring.deb SHA256:2c2601e6053d5c68c2c60bcd088fa9797acec5f285151d46de9c830aaba6173c
$ sudo apt install ./keyring.deb
$ echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/sur5r-keyring.gpg] http://debian.sur5r.net/i3/ $(grep '^VERSION_CODENAME=' /etc/os-release | cut -f2 -d=) universe" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sur5r-i3.list
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install i3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All Ubuntu versions which are currently supported by Ubuntu itself are also supported by
this repository. See link:https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases[Ubuntu releases] for details.

Packages for unsupported Ubuntu versions might exist but may disappear any time.

== Debian repository

The previously used baltocdn repositories have been discontinued and the debian repositories are to be used instead; no nightly builds are offered currently.

If you have previously added any baltocdn repositories to your apt sources, do *not* continue using them.
