<h1>User-contributed article: Swapping workspaces</h1>

<p>
If you have workspace 1 on one monitor and workspace 2 on another monitor and
want to quickly swap the workspaces among the monitors, you can use i3's IPC
mechanisms to do it.
</p>

<p>
i3 already includes a way to move an individual workspace from one monitor to
another. But what we want to achieve is the <strong>simultaneous</strong>
movement of workspaces between the monitors. To do this, we can write a script
that detects the currently active workspace on each monitor and then moves that
workspace to the other monitor.
</p>

<pre><tt>#!/usr/bin/env bash
    # requires jq
    
    DISPLAY_CONFIG=($(i3-msg -t get_outputs | jq -r '.[]|"\(.name):\(.current_workspace)"'))
    
    for ROW in "${DISPLAY_CONFIG[@]}"
    do
        IFS=':'
        read -ra CONFIG <<< "${ROW}"
        if [ "${CONFIG[0]}" != "null" ] && [ "${CONFIG[1]}" != "null" ]; then
            echo "moving ${CONFIG[1]} right..."
            i3-msg -- workspace --no-auto-back-and-forth "${CONFIG[1]}"
            i3-msg -- move workspace to output right	
        fi
    done</tt></pre>

<p>
To use this script, I recommend binding it to a keyboard shortcut in your i3 config:
</p>
<pre><tt>bindsym $mod+Shift+s exec /path/to/your/script/i3-display-swap.sh</tt></pre>
<p>
Now restart i3 in place. The next time you press mod+Shift+s, your workspaces will be swapped among your monitors.
