<h2 id="_default_keybindings">1. Default keybindings</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>For the "too long; didn’t read" people, here is an overview of the default
keybindings (click to see the full size image):</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Keys to use with Mod1 (alt):</strong></p></div>

</span></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As i3 uses keycodes in the default configuration, it does not matter which
keyboard layout you actually use. The key positions are what matters (of course
you can also use keysymbols, see <a href="#keybindings">[keybindings]</a>).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The red keys are the modifiers you need to press (by default), the blue keys
are your home row.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_using_i3">2. Using i3</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_opening_terminals_and_moving_around">2.1. Opening terminals and moving around</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One very basic operation is opening a new terminal. By default, the keybinding
for this is Mod1+Enter, that is Alt+Enter in the default configuration. By
pressing Mod1+Enter, a new terminal will be opened.  It will fill the whole
space available on your screen.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><span class="image">
<img src="single_terminal.png" alt="Single terminal" />
</span></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is important to keep in mind that i3 uses a table to manage your windows. At
the moment, you have exactly one column and one row which leaves you with one
cell. In this cell there is a container, which is where your new terminal is
opened.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you now open another terminal, you still have only one cell. However, the
container in that cell holds both of your terminals. So, a container is just a
group of clients with a specific layout. Containers can be resized by adjusting
the size of the cell that holds them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><span class="image">
<img src="two_terminals.png" alt="Two terminals" />
</span></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To move the focus between the two terminals, you use the direction keys which
you may know from the editor <tt>vi</tt>. However, in i3, your home row is used for
these keys (in <tt>vi</tt>, the keys are shifted to the left by one for compatibility
with most keyboard layouts). Therefore, <tt>Mod1+J</tt> is left, <tt>Mod1+K</tt> is down,
<tt>Mod1+L</tt> is up and <tt>Mod1+;</tt> is right. So, to switch between the terminals,
use <tt>Mod1+K</tt> or <tt>Mod1+L</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To create a new row/column (and a new cell), you can simply move a terminal (or
any other window) in the direction you want to expand your table. So, let’s
expand the table to the right by pressing <tt>Mod1+Shift+;</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><span class="image">
<img src="two_columns.png" alt="Two columns" />
</span></p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_changing_container_modes">2.2. Changing container modes</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A container can have the following modes:</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
default
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Windows are sized so that every window gets an equal amount of space in the
container.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
stacking
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Only the focused window in the container is displayed. You get a list of
windows at the top of the container.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
tabbed
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The same principle as <tt>stacking</tt>, but the list of windows at the top is only
a single line which is vertically split.
</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To switch modes, press <tt>Mod1+e</tt> for default, <tt>Mod1+h</tt> for stacking and
<tt>Mod1+w</tt> for tabbed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><span class="image">
<img src="modes.png" alt="Container modes" />
</span></p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_toggling_fullscreen_mode_for_a_window">2.3. Toggling fullscreen mode for a window</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To display a window fullscreen or to go out of fullscreen mode again, press
<tt>Mod1+f</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There is also a global fullscreen mode in i3 in which the client will use all
available outputs. To use it, or to get out of it again, press <tt>Mod1+Shift+f</tt>.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_opening_other_applications">2.4. Opening other applications</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Aside from opening applications from a terminal, you can also use the handy
<tt>dmenu</tt> which is opened by pressing <tt>Mod1+v</tt> by default. Just type the name
(or a part of it) of the application which you want to open. The application
typed has to be in your <tt>$PATH</tt> for this to work.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Additionally, if you have applications you open very frequently, you can
create a keybinding for starting the application directly. See the section
"Configuring i3" for details.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_closing_windows">2.5. Closing windows</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If an application does not provide a mechanism for closing (most applications
provide a menu, the escape key or a shortcut like <tt>Control+W</tt> to close), you
can press <tt>Mod1+Shift+q</tt> to kill a window. For applications which support
the WM_DELETE protocol, this will correctly close the application (saving
any modifications or doing other cleanup). If the application doesn’t support
the WM_DELETE protocol your X server will kill the window and the behavior
depends on the application.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_using_workspaces">2.6. Using workspaces</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Workspaces are an easy way to group a set of windows. By default, you are on
the first workspace, as the bar on the bottom left indicates. To switch to
another workspace, press <tt>Mod1+num</tt> where <tt>num</tt> is the number of the workspace
you want to use. If the workspace does not exist yet, it will be created.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A common paradigm is to put the web browser on one workspace, communication
applications (<tt>mutt</tt>, <tt>irssi</tt>, &#8230;) on another one, and the ones with which you
work, on the third one. Of course, there is no need to follow this approach.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you have multiple screens, a workspace will be created on each screen at
startup. If you open a new workspace, it will be bound to the screen you
created it on.  When you switch to a workspace on another screen, i3 will set
focus to that screen.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_moving_windows_to_workspaces">2.7. Moving windows to workspaces</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To move a window to another workspace, simply press <tt>Mod1+Shift+num</tt> where
<tt>num</tt> is (like when switching workspaces) the number of the target workspace.
Similarly to switching workspaces, the target workspace will be created if
it does not yet exist.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_resizing_columns_rows">2.8. Resizing columns/rows</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To resize columns or rows, just grab the border between the two columns/rows
and move it to the wanted size. Please keep in mind that each cell of the table
holds a <tt>container</tt> and thus you cannot horizontally resize single windows.  If
you need applications with different horizontal sizes, place them in seperate
cells one above the other.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>See <a href="#resizing_containers">[resizing_containers]</a> for how to configure i3 to be able to resize
columns/rows with your keyboard.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_restarting_i3_inplace">2.9. Restarting i3 in place</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To restart i3 in place (and thus get into a clean state if there is a bug, or
to upgrade to a newer version of i3) you can use <tt>Mod1+Shift+r</tt>. Be aware,
though, that this kills your current layout and all the windows you have opened
will be put in a default container in only one cell. Saving layouts will be
implemented in a later version.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_exiting_i3">2.10. Exiting i3</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To cleanly exit i3 without killing your X server, you can use <tt>Mod1+Shift+e</tt>.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_snapping">2.11. Snapping</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Snapping is a mechanism to increase/decrease the colspan/rowspan of a container.
Colspan/rowspan is the number of columns/rows a specific cell of the table
consumes. This is easier explained by giving an example, so take the following
layout:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><span class="image">
<img src="snapping.png" alt="Snapping example" />
</span></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To use the full size of your screen, you can now snap container 3 downwards
by pressing <tt>Mod1+Control+k</tt> (or snap container 2 rightwards).</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_floating">2.12. Floating</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Floating mode is the opposite of tiling mode. The position and size of a window
are not managed by i3, but by you. Using this mode violates the tiling
paradigm but can be useful for some corner cases like "Save as" dialog
windows, or toolbar windows (GIMP or similar).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can enable floating mode for a window by pressing <tt>Mod1+Shift+Space</tt>. By
dragging the window’s titlebar with your mouse you can move the window
around. By grabbing the borders and moving them you can resize the window. You
can also do that by using the <a href="#floating_modifier">[floating_modifier]</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For resizing floating windows with your keyboard, see <a href="#resizing_containers">[resizing_containers]</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Floating windows are always on top of tiling windows.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_configuring_i3">3. Configuring i3</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is where the real fun begins ;-). Most things are very dependant on your
ideal working environment so we can’t make reasonable defaults for them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>While not using a programming language for the configuration, i3 stays
quite flexible in regards to the things you usually want your window manager
to do.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, you can configure bindings to jump to specific windows,
you can set specific applications to start on specific workspaces, you can
automatically start applications, you can change the colors of i3, and you
can bind your keys to do useful things.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To change the configuration of i3, copy <tt>/etc/i3/config</tt> to <tt>~/.i3/config</tt>
(or <tt>~/.config/i3/config</tt> if you like the XDG directory scheme) and edit it
with a text editor.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_comments">3.1. Comments</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is possible and recommended to use comments in your configuration file to
properly document your setup for later reference. Comments are started with
a # and can only be used at the beginning of a line:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt># This is a comment</tt></pre>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_fonts">3.2. Fonts</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>i3 uses X core fonts (not Xft) for rendering window titles and the internal
workspace bar. You can use <tt>xfontsel(1)</tt> to generate such a font description.
To see special characters (Unicode), you need to use a font which supports
the ISO-10646 encoding.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Syntax</strong>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>font &lt;X core font description&gt;</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso10646-1</tt></pre>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="keybindings">3.3. Keyboard bindings</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A keyboard binding makes i3 execute a command (see below) upon pressing a
specific key. i3 allows you to bind either on keycodes or on keysyms (you can
also mix your bindings, though i3 will not protect you from overlapping ones).</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
A keysym (key symbol) is a description for a specific symbol, like "a"
  or "b", but also more strange ones like "underscore" instead of "_". These
  are the ones you use in Xmodmap to remap your keys. To get the current
  mapping of your keys, use <tt>xmodmap -pke</tt>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Keycodes do not need to have a symbol assigned (handy for some hotkeys
  on some notebooks) and they will not change their meaning as you switch to a
  different keyboard layout (when using <tt>xmodmap</tt>).
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>My recommendation is: If you often switch keyboard layouts but you want to keep
your bindings in the same physical location on the keyboard, use keycodes.
If you don’t switch layouts, and want a clean and simple config file, use
keysyms.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Syntax</strong>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>bindsym [Modifiers+]keysym command
bind [Modifiers+]keycode command</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt># Fullscreen
bindsym Mod1+f f

# Restart
bindsym Mod1+Shift+r restart

# Notebook-specific hotkeys
bind 214 exec /home/michael/toggle_beamer.sh</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Available Modifiers:</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Mod1-Mod5, Shift, Control
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Standard modifiers, see <tt>xmodmap(1)</tt>
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Mode_switch
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Unlike other window managers, i3 can use Mode_switch as a modifier. This allows
you to remap capslock (for example) to Mode_switch and use it for both: typing
umlauts or special characters <em>and</em> having some comfortably reachable key
bindings. For example, when typing, capslock+1 or capslock+2 for switching
workspaces is totally convenient. Try it :-).
</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="floating_modifier">3.4. The floating modifier</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To move floating windows with your mouse, you can either grab their titlebar
or configure the so called floating modifier which you can then press and
click anywhere in the window itself to move it. The most common setup is to
use the same key you use for managing windows (Mod1 for example). Then
you can press Mod1, click into a window using your left mouse button, and drag
it to the position you want.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When holding the floating modifier, you can resize a floating window by
pressing the right mouse button on it and moving around while holding it. If
you hold the shift button as well, the resize will be proportional.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Syntax</strong>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>floating_modifier &lt;Modifiers&gt;</tt></pre>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_variables">3.7. Variables</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As you learned in the section about keyboard bindings, you will have
to configure lots of bindings containing modifier keys. If you want to save
yourself some typing and be able to change the modifier you use later,
variables can be handy.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Syntax</strong>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>set name value</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>set $m Mod1
bindsym $m+Shift+r restart</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Variables are directly replaced in the file when parsing. There is no fancy
handling and there are absolutely no plans to change this. If you need a more
dynamic configuration you should create a little script which generates a
configuration file and run it before starting i3 (for example in your
<tt>.xsession</tt> file).</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_automatically_putting_clients_on_specific_workspaces">3.8. Automatically putting clients on specific workspaces</h3>
<div class="paragraph" id="assign_workspace"><p>It is recommended that you match on window classes wherever possible because
some applications first create their window, and then worry about setting the
correct title. Firefox with Vimperator comes to mind. The window starts up
being named Firefox, and only when Vimperator is loaded does the title change.
As i3 will get the title as soon as the application maps the window (mapping
means actually displaying it on the screen), you’d need to have to match on
<em>Firefox</em> in this case.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can prefix or suffix workspaces with a <tt>~</tt> to specify that matching clients
should be put into floating mode. If you specify only a <tt>~</tt>, the client will
not be put onto any workspace, but will be set floating on the current one.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Syntax</strong>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>assign ["]window class[/window title]["] [→] [~ | workspace]</tt></pre>

assign "xv/MPlayer" → ~</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that the arrow is not required, it just looks good :-). If you decide to
use it, it has to be a UTF-8 encoded arrow, not "&#8594;" or something like that.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_automatically_starting_applications_on_i3_startup">3.9. Automatically starting applications on i3 startup</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>By using the <tt>exec</tt> keyword outside a keybinding, you can configure which
commands will be performed by i3 on initial startup (not when restarting i3
in-place however). These commands will be run in order.</p></div>

<h3 id="workspace_screen">3.10. Automatically putting workspaces on specific screens</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you assign clients to workspaces, it might be handy to put the
workspaces on specific screens. Also, the assignment of workspaces to screens
will determine which workspace i3 uses for a new screen when adding screens
or when starting (e.g., by default it will use 1 for the first screen, 2 for
the second screen and so on).</p></div>

an arbitrary label and use it afterwards.  You do not need to ensure that your
windows have unique classes or titles, and you do not need to change your
configuration file.</p></div>

window, you cannot simply bind it to a key.  <tt>i3-input</tt> is a tool created

<h2 id="multi_monitor">5. Multiple monitors</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>As you can see in the goal list on the website, i3 was specifically developed
with support for multiple monitors in mind. This section will explain how to
handle multiple monitors.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When you have only one monitor, things are simple. You usually start with
workspace 1 on your monitor and open new ones as you need them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When you have more than one monitor, each monitor will get an initial
workspace.  The first monitor gets 1, the second gets 2 and a possible third
would get 3. When you switch to a workspace on a different monitor, i3 will
switch to that monitor and then switch to the workspace. This way, you don’t
need shortcuts to switch to a specific monitor, and you don’t need to remember
where you put which workspace. New workspaces will be opened on the currently
active monitor.  It is not possible to have a monitor without a workspace.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The idea of making workspaces global is based on the observation that most
users have a very limited set of workspaces on their additional monitors.
They are often used for a specific task (browser, shell) or for monitoring
several things (mail, IRC, syslog, …). Thus, using one workspace on one monitor
and "the rest" on the other monitors often makes sense. However, as you can
create an unlimited number of workspaces in i3 and tie them to specific
screens, you can have the "traditional" approach of having X workspaces per
screen by changing your configuration (using modes, for example).</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_configuring_your_monitors">5.1. Configuring your monitors</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To help you get going if you have never used multiple monitors before, here is
a short overview of the xrandr options which will probably be of interest to

If you have many workspaces on many monitors, it might get hard to keep
   track of which window you put where. Thus, you can use vim-like marks to
   quickly switch between windows. See <a href="#vim_like_marks">[vim_like_marks]</a>.

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_displaying_a_status_line">6.1. Displaying a status line</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A very common thing amongst users of exotic window managers is a status line at
some corner of the screen. It is an often superior replacement to the widget
approach you have in the task bar of a traditional desktop environment.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you don’t already have your favorite way of generating such a status line
(self-written scripts, conky, …), then i3status is the recommended tool for
this task. It was written in C with the goal of using as few syscalls as
possible to reduce the time your CPU is woken up from sleep states.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Regardless of which application you use to generate the status line, you
want to make sure that the application does one of the following things:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Register as a dock window using EWMH hints. This will make i3 position the
   window above the workspace bar but below every other client. This is the
   recommended way, but in case of dzen2, for example, you need to check out
   the source of dzen2 from subversion, as the -dock option is not present
   in the released versions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Overlay the internal workspace bar. This method will not waste any space
   on the workspace bar, however, it is rather hackish. Just configure
   the output window to be over the workspace bar (say -x 200 and -y 780 if
   your screen is 800 px height).
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The planned solution for this problem is to make the workspace bar optional
and switch to a third party application completely (dzen2 for example)
which will then contain the workspace bar.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_giving_presentations_multi_monitor">6.2. Giving presentations (multi-monitor)</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When giving a presentation, you typically want the audience to see what you see
on your screen and then go through a series of slides (if the presentation is
simple). For more complex presentations, you might want to have some notes
which only you can see on your screen, while the audience can only see the
slides.</p></div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="presentations">6.2.1. Case 1: everybody gets the same output</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is the simple case. You connect your computer to the video projector,
turn on both (computer and video projector) and configure your X server to
clone the internal flat panel of your computer to the video output:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768 --same-as LVDS1</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>i3 will then use the lowest common subset of screen resolutions, the rest of
your screen will be left untouched (it will show the X background). So, in
our example, this would be 1024x768 (my notebook has 1280x800).</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_case_2_you_can_see_more_than_your_audience">6.2.2. Case 2: you can see more than your audience</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This case is a bit harder. First of all, you should configure the VGA output
somewhere near your internal flat panel, say right of it:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768 --right-of LVDS1</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, i3 will put a new workspace (depending on your settings) on the new screen
and you are in multi-monitor mode (see <a href="#multi_monitor">[multi_monitor]</a>).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Because i3 is not a compositing window manager, there is no ability to
display a window on two screens at the same time. Instead, your presentation
software needs to do this job (that is, open a window on each screen).</p></div>
