<h2 id="_window_managers">1. Window Managers</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>A window manager is not necessarily needed to run X, but it is usually used in
combination with X to facilitate some things. The window manager&#8217;s job is to
take care of the placement of windows, to provide the user with some mechanisms
to change the position/size of windows and to communicate with clients to a
certain extent (for example handle fullscreen requests of clients such as
MPlayer).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are no different contexts in which X11 clients run, so a window manager
is just another client, like all other X11 applications. However, it handles
some events which normal clients usually don’t handle.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the case of i3, the tasks (and order of them) are the following:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Grab the key bindings (events will be sent upon keypress/keyrelease)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Iterate through all existing windows (if the window manager is not started as
  the first client of X) and manage them (reparent them, create window
  decorations, etc.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When new windows are created, manage them
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handle the client’s <tt>_WM_STATE</tt> property, but only the <tt>_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN</tt>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handle the client’s <tt>WM_NAME</tt> property
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handle the client’s size hints to display them proportionally
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handle the client’s urgency hint
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handle enter notifications (focus follows mouse)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handle button (as in mouse buttons) presses for focus/raise on click
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handle expose events to re-draw own windows such as decorations
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
React to the user’s commands: Change focus, Move windows, Switch workspaces,
  Change the layout mode of a container (default/stacking/tabbed), start a new
  application, restart the window manager
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the following chapters, each of these tasks and their implementation details
will be discussed.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tiling_window_managers">1.1. Tiling window managers</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Traditionally, there are two approaches to managing windows: The most common
one nowadays is floating, which means the user can freely move/resize the
windows. The other approach is called tiling, which means that your window
manager distributes windows to use as much space as possible while not
overlapping each other.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The idea behind tiling is that you should not need to waste your time
moving/resizing windows while you usually want to get some work done. After
all, most users sooner or later tend to lay out their windows in a way which
corresponds to tiling or stacking mode in i3. Therefore, why not let i3 do this
for you? Certainly, it’s faster than you could ever do it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The problem with most tiling window managers is that they are too unflexible.
In my opinion, a window manager is just another tool, and similar to vim which
can edit all kinds of text files (like source code, HTML, …) and is not limited
to a specific file type, a window manager should not limit itself to a certain
layout (like dwm, awesome, …) but provide mechanisms for you to easily create
the layout you need at the moment.</p></div>

<h3 id="_virtual_screens">3.1. Virtual screens</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual screen (type <tt>i3Screen</tt>) is generated from the connected outputs
obtained through RandR. The difference to the raw RandR outputs as seen
when using <tt>xrandr(1)</tt> is that it falls back to the lowest common resolution of
the actual enabled outputs.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, if your notebook has a screen resolution of 1280x800 px and you
connect a video projector with a resolution of 1024x768 px, set it up in clone
mode (<tt>xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768 --same-as LVDS1</tt>), i3 will have
one virtual screen.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, if you configure it using <tt>xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768
--right-of LVDS1</tt>, i3 will generate two virtual screens. For each virtual
screen, a new workspace will be assigned. New workspaces are created on the

so an <tt>SLIST</tt> works fine. If inserting elements at arbitrary positions or at
the end of a list is necessary, a <tt>TAILQ</tt> is used instead. However, for the

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_grabbing_the_bindings">7.1. Grabbing the bindings</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Grabbing the bindings is quite straight-forward. You pass X your combination of
modifiers and the keycode you want to grab and whether you want to grab them
actively or passively. Most bindings (everything except for bindings using
Mode_switch) are grabbed passively, that is, just the window manager gets the
event and cannot replay it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We need to grab bindings that use Mode_switch actively because of a bug in X.
When the window manager receives the keypress/keyrelease event for an actively
grabbed keycode, it has to decide what to do with this event: It can either
replay it so that other applications get it or it can prevent other
applications from receiving it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, why do we need to grab keycodes actively? Because X does not set the
state-property of keypress/keyrelease events properly. The Mode_switch bit is
not set and we need to get it using XkbGetState. This means we cannot pass X
our combination of modifiers containing Mode_switch when grabbing the key and
therefore need to grab the keycode itself without any modifiers. This means,
if you bind Mode_switch + keycode 38 ("a"), i3 will grab keycode 38 ("a") and
check on each press of "a" if the Mode_switch bit is set using XKB. If yes, it
will handle the event, if not, it will replay the event.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_handling_a_keypress">7.2. Handling a keypress</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As mentioned in "Grabbing the bindings", upon a keypress event, i3 first gets
the correct state.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then, it looks through all bindings and gets the one which matches the received
event.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The bound command is parsed by the cmdparse lexer/parser, see <tt>parse_cmd</tt> in

<h2 id="_manage_windows_src_main_c_manage_window_and_reparent_window">8. Manage windows (src/main.c, manage_window() and reparent_window())</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p><tt>manage_window()</tt> does some checks to decide whether the window should be
managed at all:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Windows have to be mapped, that is, visible on screen
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The override_redirect must not be set. Windows with override_redirect shall
   not be managed by a window manager
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Afterwards, i3 gets the intial geometry and reparents the window (see
<tt>reparent_window()</tt>) if it wasn’t already managed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Reparenting means that for each window which is reparented, a new window,
slightly larger than the original one, is created. The original window is then
reparented to the bigger one (called "frame").</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After reparenting, the window type (<tt>_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE</tt>) is checked to see
whether this window is a dock (<tt>_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK</tt>), like dzen2 for
example. Docks are handled differently, they don’t have decorations and are not
assigned to a specific container. Instead, they are positioned at the bottom
of the screen. To get the height which needs to be reserved for the window,
the <tt>_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL</tt> property is used.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Furthermore, the list of assignments (to other workspaces, which may be on
other screens) is checked. If the window matches one of the user’s criteria,
it may either be put in floating mode or moved to a different workspace. If the
target workspace is not visible, the window will not be mapped.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_what_happens_when_an_application_is_started">9. What happens when an application is started?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>i3 does not care for applications. All it notices is when new windows are
mapped (see <tt>src/handlers.c</tt>, <tt>handle_map_request()</tt>). The window is then
reparented (see section "Manage windows").</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After reparenting the window, <tt>render_tree()</tt> is called which renders the
internal layout table. The new window has been placed in the currently focused
container and therefore the new window and the old windows (if any) need to be
moved/resized so that the currently active layout (default/stacking/tabbed mode)
is rendered correctly. To move/resize windows, a window is &#8220;configured&#8221; in
X11-speak.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some applications, such as MPlayer obviously assume the window manager is
stupid and try to configure their windows by themselves. This generates an
event called configurerequest. i3 handles these events and tells the window the
size it had before the configurerequest (with the exception of not yet mapped
windows, which get configured like they want to, and floating windows, which
can reconfigure themselves).</p></div>

<h2 id="_net_wm_state">10. _NET_WM_STATE</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Only the _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN atom is handled. It calls
&#8220;toggle_fullscreen()&#8221; for the specific client which just configures the
client to use the whole screen on which it currently is. Also, it is set as
fullscreen_client for the i3Screen.</p></div>

<h2 id="_wm_name">11. WM_NAME</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>When the WM_NAME property of a window changes, its decoration (containing the
title) is re-rendered. Note that WM_NAME is in COMPOUND_TEXT encoding which is
totally uncommon and cumbersome. Therefore, the _NET_WM_NAME atom will be used
if present.</p></div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_net_wm_name">12. _NET_WM_NAME</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Like WM_NAME, this atom contains the title of a window. However, _NET_WM_NAME
is encoded in UTF-8. i3 will recode it to UCS-2 in order to be able to pass it
to X. Using an appropriate font (ISO-10646), you can see most special
characters (every special character contained in your font).</p></div>

<h2 id="_size_hints">13. Size hints</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Size hints specify the minimum/maximum size for a given window as well as its
aspect ratio.  This is important for clients like mplayer, who only set the
aspect ratio and resize their window to be as small as possible (but only with
some video outputs, for example in Xv, while when using x11, mplayer does the
necessary centering for itself).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, when an aspect ratio was specified, i3 adjusts the height of the window
until the size maintains the correct aspect ratio. For the code to do this, see
src/layout.c, function resize_client().</p></div>

vertical. Now it will again search for parent containers with vertical
