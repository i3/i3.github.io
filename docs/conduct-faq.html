<h2>Code of Conduct: FAQ</h2>

<p>
Largely taken from <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/faq/">django</a>. Thanks!
</p>

<p>
This FAQ attempts to address common questions and concerns around the i3
community's <a href="/conduct">Code of Conduct</a>. If you still have
questions after reading it, please feel free to contact us at conduct AT i3wm DOT org.
</p>

<h3 id="why-adopt">Why have you adopted a Code of Conduct?</h3>

    <p>We think the i3 community is awesome. If you're familiar with the i3
    community, you'll probably notice that the Code basically matches what
    we already do. Think of this as documentation: we're taking implicit
    expectations about behavior and making them explicit.</p>

    <p>We know that the i3 community is open, friendly, and welcoming. We want to
    make sure everyone else knows it too.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-it-mean">What does it mean to "adopt" a Code of Conduct?</h3>

    <p>For the most part, we don't think it means large changes. We think that the text
    does a really good job describing the way the i3 community already conducts
    itself. We expect that most people will simply continue to behave in the
    awesome way they have for years.</p>

    <p>However, we do expect that people will abide by the spirit and words of the CoC
    when in "official" i3 spaces.</p>

    <p>In practice, this means mailing lists (i3-discuss), the i3 IRC channel
    (<tt>#i3</tt>), bug tracking and code review tools. In addition, violations
    of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to
    participate within them.</p>

<h3 id="violations">What happens if someone violates the Code of Conduct?</h3>

    <p>Our intent is that the anyone in the community can stand up for this code,
    and direct people who're unaware to this document. If that doesn't work,
    or if you need more help, you can contact conduct AT i3wm DOT org.
    For more details please see our
    <a href="/conduct-reporting">Reporting Guidelines</a></p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-need">Why do we need a Code of Conduct? Everyone knows not to be a jerk.</h3>

    <p>Sadly, not everyone knows this.</p>

    <p>However, even if everyone was kind, everyone was compassionate, and everyone was
    familiar with codes of conduct it would still be incumbent upon our community to
    publish our own. Maintaining a code of conduct forces us to consider and
    articulate what kind of community we want to be, and serves as a constant
    reminder to put our best foot forward. But most importantly, it serves as a
    signpost to people looking to join our community that we feel these values are
    important.</p>

<h3 id="free-speech">This is censorship! I have the right to say whatever I want!</h3>

    <p>You do -- in <em>your</em> space. If you'd like to hang out in <em>our</em> spaces (as
    clarified above), we have some simple guidelines to follow. If you want to, for
    example, form a group where i3 is discussed using language inappropriate for
    general channels then nobody's stopping you. We respect your right to establish
    whatever codes of conduct you want in the spaces that belong to you. Please
    honor this Code of Conduct in our spaces.</p>
