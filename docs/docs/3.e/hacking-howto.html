<h2 id="_window_managers">1. Window Managers</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>A window manager is not necessarily needed to run X, but it is usually used in
combination with X to facilitate some things. The window manager&#8217;s job is to
take care of the placement of windows, to provide the user with some mechanisms
to change the position/size of windows and to communicate with clients to a
certain extent (for example handle fullscreen requests of clients such as
MPlayer).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are no different contexts in which X11 clients run, so a window manager
is just another client, like all other X11 applications. However, it handles
some events which normal clients usually don’t handle.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the case of i3, the tasks (and order of them) are the following:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Grab the key bindings (events will be sent upon keypress/keyrelease)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Iterate through all existing windows (if the window manager is not started as
  the first client of X) and manage them (reparent them, create window
  decorations, etc.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When new windows are created, manage them
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handle the client’s <tt>_WM_STATE</tt> property, but only the <tt>_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN</tt>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handle the client’s <tt>WM_NAME</tt> property
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handle the client’s size hints to display them proportionally
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handle the client’s urgency hint
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handle enter notifications (focus follows mouse)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handle button (as in mouse buttons) presses for focus/raise on click
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handle expose events to re-draw own windows such as decorations
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
React to the user’s commands: Change focus, Move windows, Switch workspaces,
  Change the layout mode of a container (default/stacking/tabbed), start a new
  application, restart the window manager
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the following chapters, each of these tasks and their implementation details
will be discussed.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tiling_window_managers">1.1. Tiling window managers</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Traditionally, there are two approaches to managing windows: The most common
one nowadays is floating, which means the user can freely move/resize the
windows. The other approach is called tiling, which means that your window
manager distributes windows to use as much space as possible while not
overlapping each other.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The idea behind tiling is that you should not need to waste your time
moving/resizing windows while you usually want to get some work done. After
all, most users sooner or later tend to lay out their windows in a way which
corresponds to tiling or stacking mode in i3. Therefore, why not let i3 do this
for you? Certainly, it’s faster than you could ever do it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The problem with most tiling window managers is that they are too unflexible.
In my opinion, a window manager is just another tool, and similar to vim which
can edit all kinds of text files (like source code, HTML, …) and is not limited
to a specific file type, a window manager should not limit itself to a certain
layout (like dwm, awesome, …) but provide mechanisms for you to easily create
the layout you need at the moment.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_layout_table">1.2. The layout table</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To accomplish flexible layouts, we decided to simply use a table. The table
grows and shrinks as you need it. Each cell holds a container which then holds
windows (see picture below). You can use different layouts for each container
(default layout and stacking layout).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, when you open a terminal and immediately open another one, they reside in
the same container, in default layout. The layout table has exactly one column,
one row and therefore one cell. When you move one of the terminals to the
right, the table needs to grow. It will be expanded to two columns and one row.
This enables you to have different layouts for each container. The table then
looks like this:</p></div>
<div class="tableblock">
<table rules="all"
width="15%"
frame="border"
cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="top"><p class="table">T1</p></td>
<td align="center" valign="top"><p class="table">T2</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When moving terminal 2 to the bottom, the table will be expanded again.</p></div>
<div class="tableblock">
<table rules="all"
width="15%"
frame="border"
cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />

<td align="center" valign="top"><p class="table"></p></td>
<td align="center" valign="top"><p class="table">T2</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can really think of the layout table like a traditional HTML table, if
you’ve ever designed one. Especially col- and rowspan work similarly. Below,
you see an example of colspan=2 for the first container (which has T1 as
window).</p></div>
<div class="tableblock">
<table rules="all"

frame="border"
cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">

<h3 id="_virtual_screens">3.1. Virtual screens</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual screen (type <tt>i3Screen</tt>) is generated from the connected screens
obtained through Xinerama. The difference to the raw Xinerama monitors as seen
when using <tt>xrandr(1)</tt> is that it falls back to the lowest common resolution of
the logical screens.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, if your notebook has 1280x800 and you connect a video projector
with 1024x768, set up in clone mode (<tt>xrandr --output VGA --mode 1024x768
--same-as LVDS</tt>), i3 will have one virtual screen.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, if you configure it using <tt>xrandr --output VGA --mode 1024x768
--right-of LVDS</tt>, i3 will generate two virtual screens. For each virtual
screen, a new workspace will be assigned. New workspaces are created on the
screen you are currently on.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_workspace">3.2. Workspace</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A workspace is identified by its number. Basically, you could think of
workspaces as different desks in your office, if you like the desktop
methaphor. They just contain different sets of windows and are completely
separate of each other. Other window managers also call this &#8220;Virtual
desktops&#8221;.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_layout_table_2">3.3. The layout table</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Each workspace has a table, which is just a two-dimensional dynamic array
containing Containers (see below). This table grows and shrinks as you need it
(by moving windows to the right you can create a new column in the table, by
moving them to the bottom you create a new row).</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_container">3.4. Container</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A container is the content of a table’s cell. It holds an arbitrary amount of
windows and has a specific layout (default layout, stack layout or tabbed
layout). Containers can consume multiple table cells by modifying their
colspan/rowspan attribute.</p></div>

<h2 id="_list_queue_macros">4. List/queue macros</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>i3 makes heavy use of the list macros defined in BSD operating systems. To
ensure that the operating system on which i3 is compiled has all the expected
features, i3 comes with <tt>include/queue.h</tt>. On BSD systems, you can use man
<tt>queue(3)</tt>. On Linux, you have to use google (or read the source).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The lists used are <tt>SLIST</tt> (single linked lists), <tt>CIRCLEQ</tt> (circular
queues) and TAILQ (tail queues). Usually, only forward traversal is necessary,
so an <tt>SLIST</tt> works fine. If inserting elements at arbitrary positions or at
the end of a list is necessary, a <tt>TAILQ</tt> is used instead. However, for the
windows inside a container, a <tt>CIRCLEQ</tt> is necessary to go from the currently
selected window to the window above/below.</p></div>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_grabbing_the_bindings">7.1. Grabbing the bindings</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Grabbing the bindings is quite straight-forward. You pass X your combination of
modifiers and the keycode you want to grab and whether you want to grab them
actively or passively. Most bindings (everything except for bindings using
Mode_switch) are grabbed passively, that is, just the window manager gets the
event and cannot replay it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We need to grab bindings that use Mode_switch actively because of a bug in X.
When the window manager receives the keypress/keyrelease event for an actively
grabbed keycode, it has to decide what to do with this event: It can either
replay it so that other applications get it or it can prevent other
applications from receiving it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, why do we need to grab keycodes actively? Because X does not set the
state-property of keypress/keyrelease events properly. The Mode_switch bit is
not set and we need to get it using XkbGetState. This means we cannot pass X
our combination of modifiers containing Mode_switch when grabbing the key and
therefore need to grab the keycode itself without any modifiers. This means,
if you bind Mode_switch + keycode 38 ("a"), i3 will grab keycode 38 ("a") and
check on each press of "a" if the Mode_switch bit is set using XKB. If yes, it
will handle the event, if not, it will replay the event.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_handling_a_keypress">7.2. Handling a keypress</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As mentioned in "Grabbing the bindings", upon a keypress event, i3 first gets
the correct state.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then, it looks through all bindings and gets the one which matches the received
event.</p></div>

<h2 id="_manage_windows_src_mainx_c_manage_window_and_reparent_window">8. Manage windows (src/mainx.c, manage_window() and reparent_window())</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p><tt>manage_window()</tt> does some checks to decide whether the window should be
managed at all:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Windows have to be mapped, that is, visible on screen
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The override_redirect must not be set. Windows with override_redirect shall
   not be managed by a window manager
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Afterwards, i3 gets the intial geometry and reparents the window (see
<tt>reparent_window()</tt>) if it wasn’t already managed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Reparenting means that for each window which is reparented, a new window,
slightly larger than the original one, is created. The original window is then
reparented to the bigger one (called "frame").</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After reparenting, the window type (<tt>_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE</tt>) is checked to see
whether this window is a dock (<tt>_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK</tt>), like dzen2 for
example. Docks are handled differently, they don’t have decorations and are not
assigned to a specific container. Instead, they are positioned at the bottom
of the screen. To get the height which needsd to be reserved for the window,
the <tt>_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL</tt> property is used.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Furthermore, the list of assignments (to other workspaces, which may be on
other screens) is checked. If the window matches one of the user’s criteria,
it may either be put in floating mode or moved to a different workspace. If the
target workspace is not visible, the window will not be mapped.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_what_happens_when_an_application_is_started">9. What happens when an application is started?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>i3 does not care for applications. All it notices is when new windows are
mapped (see <tt>src/handlers.c</tt>, <tt>handle_map_request()</tt>). The window is then
reparented (see section "Manage windows").</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After reparenting the window, <tt>render_layout()</tt> is called which renders the
internal layout table. The new window has been placed in the currently focused
container and therefore the new window and the old windows (if any) need to be
moved/resized so that the currently active layout (default/stacking/tabbed mode)
is rendered correctly. To move/resize windows, a window is &#8220;configured&#8221; in
X11-speak.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some applications, such as MPlayer obviously assume the window manager is
stupid and try to configure their windows by themselves. This generates an
event called configurerequest. i3 handles these events and tells the window the
size it had before the configurerequest (with the exception of not yet mapped
windows, which get configured like they want to, and floating windows, which
can reconfigure themselves).</p></div>

<h2 id="_net_wm_state">10. _NET_WM_STATE</h2>

is encoded in UTF-8. i3 will recode it to UCS-2 in order to be able to pass it
to X. Using an appropriate font (ISO-10646), you can see most special
characters (every special character contained in your font).</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_size_hints">13. Size hints</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Size hints specify the minimum/maximum size for a given window as well as its
aspect ratio.  This is important for clients like mplayer, who only set the
aspect ratio and resize their window to be as small as possible (but only with
some video outputs, for example in Xv, while when using x11, mplayer does the
necessary centering for itself).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, when an aspect ratio was specified, i3 adjusts the height of the window
until the size maintains the correct aspect ratio. For the code to do this, see
src/layout.c, function resize_client().</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_rendering_src_layout_c_render_layout_and_render_container">14. Rendering (src/layout.c, render_layout() and render_container())</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are several entry points to rendering: <tt>render_layout()</tt>,
<tt>render_workspace()</tt> and <tt>render_container()</tt>. The former one calls
<tt>render_workspace()</tt> for every screen, which in turn will call
<tt>render_container()</tt> for every container inside its layout table. Therefore, if
you need to render only a single container, for example because a window was
removed, added or changed its title, you should directly call
render_container().</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Rendering consists of two steps: In the first one, in <tt>render_workspace()</tt>, each
container gets its position (screen offset + offset in the table) and size
(container&#8217;s width times colspan/rowspan). Then, <tt>render_container()</tt> is called,
which takes different approaches, depending on the mode the container is in:</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_common_parts">14.1. Common parts</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On the frame (the window which was created around the client’s window for the
decorations), a black rectangle is drawn as a background for windows like
MPlayer, which do not completely fit into the frame.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_default_mode">14.2. Default mode</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Each clients gets the container’s width and an equal amount of height.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_stack_mode">14.3. Stack mode</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In stack mode, a window containing the decorations of all windows inside the
container is placed at the top. The currently focused window is then given the
whole remaining space.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tabbed_mode">14.4. Tabbed mode</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tabbed mode is like stack mode, except that the window decorations are drawn
in one single line at the top of the container.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_window_decorations">14.5. Window decorations</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The window decorations consist of a rectangle in the appropriate color (depends
on whether this window is the currently focused one, the last focused one in a
not focused container or not focused at all) forming the background.
Afterwards, two lighter lines are drawn and the last step is drawing the
window’s title (see WM_NAME) onto it.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_fullscreen_windows">14.6. Fullscreen windows</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For fullscreen windows, the <tt>rect</tt> (x, y, width, height) is not changed to
allow the client to easily go back to its previous position. Instead,
fullscreen windows are skipped when rendering.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_resizing_containers">14.7. Resizing containers</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>By clicking and dragging the border of a container, you can resize the whole
column (respectively row) which this container is in. This is necessary to keep
the table layout working and consistent.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The resizing works similarly to the resizing of floating windows or movement of
floating windows:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
A new, invisible window with the size of the root window is created
  (<tt>grabwin</tt>)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Another window, 2px width and as high as your screen (or vice versa for
  horizontal resizing) is created. Its background color is the border color and
  it is only there to inform the user how big the container will be (it
  creates the impression of dragging the border out of the container).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <tt>drag_pointer</tt> function of <tt>src/floating.c</tt> is called to grab the pointer
  and enter its own event loop which will pass all events (expose events) but
  motion notify events. This function then calls the specified callback
  (<tt>resize_callback</tt>) which does some boundary checking and moves the helper
  window. As soon as the mouse button is released, this loop will be
  terminated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The new width_factor for each involved column (respectively row) will be
  calculated.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="_user_commands_commandmode_src_commands_c">15. User commands / commandmode (src/commands.c)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Like in vim, you can control i3 using commands. They are intended to be a
powerful alternative to lots of shortcuts, because they can be combined. There
are a few special commands, which are the following:</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
exec &lt;command&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Starts the given command by passing it to <tt>/bin/sh</tt>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
restart
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Restarts i3 by executing <tt>argv[0]</tt> (the path with which you started i3) without
forking.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
w
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
"With". This is used to select a bunch of windows. Currently, only selecting
the whole container in which the window is in, is supported by specifying "w".
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
f, s, d
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Toggle fullscreen, stacking, default mode for the current window/container.
</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The other commands are to be combined with a direction. The directions are h,
j, k and l, like in vim (h = left, j = down, k = up, l = right). When you just
specify the direction keys, i3 will move the focus in that direction. You can
provide "m" or "s" before the direction to move a window respectively or snap.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_gotchas">16. Gotchas</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Forgetting to call <tt>xcb_flush(conn);</tt> after sending a request. This usually
  leads to code which looks like it works fine but which does not work under
  certain conditions.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>

<h2 id="_using_git_sending_patches">17. Using git / sending patches</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>For a short introduction into using git, see
<a href="http://www.spheredev.org/wiki/Git_for_the_lazy">http://www.spheredev.org/wiki/Git_for_the_lazy</a> or, for more documentation, see
<a href="http://git-scm.com/documentation">http://git-scm.com/documentation</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When you want to send a patch because you fixed a bug or implemented a cool
feature (please talk to us before working on features to see whether they are
maybe already implemented, not possible for some some reason, or don’t fit
into the concept), please use git to create a patchfile.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>First of all, update your working copy to the latest version of the master
branch:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>git pull</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Afterwards, make the necessary changes for your bugfix/feature. Then, review
the changes using <tt>git diff</tt> (you might want to enable colors in the diff using
<tt>git config diff.color auto</tt>).  When you are definitely done, use <tt>git commit
-a</tt> to commit all changes you’ve made.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then, use the following command to generate a patchfile which we can directly
apply to the branch, preserving your commit message and name:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>git format-patch origin</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Just send us the generated file via email.</p></div>
