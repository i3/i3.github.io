<p>We use the <code>AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR</code> macro to enforce builds happening in a separate
directory. This is a prerequisite for the <code>AX_EXTEND_SRCDIR</code> macro and building
in a separate directory is common practice anyway. In case this causes any
trouble when packaging i3 for your distribution, please open an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>make check</code> runs the i3 testsuite. See docs/testsuite for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>make distcheck</code> (runs testsuite on <code>make dist</code> result, tiny bit quicker
feedback cycle than waiting for the travis build to catch the issue).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>make uninstall</code> (occasionally requested by users who compile from source)</p>

<li>
<p><code>make</code> will build manpages/docs by default if the tools are installed.
Conversely, manpages/docs are not tried to be built for users who don’t want
to install all these dependencies to get started hacking on i3. Manpages and
docs can be disabled with the <code>--disable-mans<code> and </code>--disable-docs</code>+
configure options respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>non-release builds will enable address sanitizer by default. Use the
<code>--disable-sanitizers</code> configure option to turn off all sanitizers, and see
<code>--help</code> for available sanitizers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please talk to us before working on new features to see whether they will be
accepted. A good way for this is to open an issue and asking for opinions on it.
Even for accepted features, this can be a good way to refine an idea upfront.
However, we don&#8217;t want to see certain features in i3, e.g., switching window
focus in an Alt+Tab like way.</p>

<p>When working on bugfixes, please make sure you mention that you are working on it
in the corresponding bug report at <a href="https://github.com/i3/i3/issues" class="bare">https://github.com/i3/i3/issues</a>. In case there
is no bug report yet, please create one.</p>

<p>After you are done, please submit your work for review as a pull request at
<a href="https://github.com/i3/i3" class="bare">https://github.com/i3/i3</a>. In order to make your review go as fast as possible,
you could have a look at previous reviews and see what the common mistakes are.</p>

<p>Work on i3 generally happens in two branches: “next” (default) and “stable”.</p>

<p>The contents of “stable” are always stable. That is, it contains the source code
of the latest release, plus any bugfixes that were applied since that release.</p>

<h2 id="_window_managers">Window Managers</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A window manager is not necessarily needed to run X, but it is usually used in
combination with X to facilitate some things. The window manager&#8217;s job is to
take care of the placement of windows, to provide the user with some mechanisms
to change the position/size of windows and to communicate with clients to a
certain extent (for example handle fullscreen requests of clients such as
MPlayer).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are no different contexts in which X11 clients run, so a window manager
is just another client, like all other X11 applications. However, it handles
some events which normal clients usually don’t handle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of i3, the tasks (and order of them) are the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Grab the key bindings (events will be sent upon keypress/keyrelease)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterate through all existing windows (if the window manager is not started as
the first client of X) and manage them (reparent them, create window
decorations, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When new windows are created, manage them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handle the client’s <code>_WM_STATE</code> property, but only <code>_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN</code> and
<code>_NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handle the client’s <code>WM_NAME</code> property</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handle the client’s size hints to display them proportionally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handle the client’s urgency hint</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handle enter notifications (focus follows mouse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handle button (as in mouse buttons) presses for focus/raise on click</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handle expose events to re-draw own windows such as decorations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>React to the user’s commands: Change focus, Move windows, Switch workspaces,
Change the layout mode of a container (default/stacking/tabbed), start a new
application, restart the window manager</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the following chapters, each of these tasks and their implementation details
will be discussed.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tiling_window_managers">Tiling window managers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Traditionally, there are two approaches to managing windows: The most common one
nowadays is stacking (or floating, using i3&#8217;s terminology), which means the user
can freely move/resize the windows, potentially overlapping them. The other
approach is called tiling, which means that the window manager distributes
windows to use as much space as possible while not overlapping each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea behind tiling is that you should not need to waste your time
moving/resizing windows while you usually want to get some work done. After
all, most users sooner or later tend to lay out their windows in a way which
corresponds to tiling or stacking mode in i3. Therefore, why not let i3 do this
for you? Certainly, it’s faster than you could ever do it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with most tiling window managers is that they are too inflexible.
In my opinion, a window manager is just another tool, and similar to vim which
can edit all kinds of text files (like source code, HTML, …) and is not limited
to a specific file type, a window manager should not limit itself to a certain
layout (like dwm, awesome, …) but provide mechanisms for you to easily create
the layout you need at the moment.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_layout_tree">The layout tree</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The data structure which i3 uses to keep track of your windows is a tree. Every
node in the tree is a container (type <code>Con</code>). Some containers represent actual
windows (every container with a <code>window != NULL</code>), some represent split
containers and a few have special purposes: they represent workspaces, outputs
(like VGA1, LVDS1, …) or the X11 root window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, when you open a terminal and immediately open another one, they reside in
the same split container, which uses the default layout. In case of an empty
workspace, the split container we are talking about is the workspace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get an impression of how different layouts are represented, just play around
and look at the data structures&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;they are exposed as a JSON hash. See
<a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html#_tree_reply" class="bare">https://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html#_tree_reply</a> for documentation on that and an
example.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_files">Files</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>i3&#8217;s source code is in the <code>src</code> folder while header files reside in <code>include</code>.
Other tools such as i3bar and i3-nagbar have their own folders. i3 and its tools
share an internal library called &#8220;libi3&#8221; which also has its own folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following list gives an overview of the codebase, explaining the
functionality of the most important, core source code files. Other files in the
tree that are not mentioned here implement specific functionalities: for example,
<code>src/scratchpad.c</code> is obviously about the scratchpad functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">include/data.h</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains data definitions used by nearly all files.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">include/*.h</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains forward definitions for all public functions, as well as
doxygen-compatible comments (so if you want to get a bit more of the big
picture, either browse all header files or use doxygen if you prefer that).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/config_directives.c</dt>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/commands.c</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contain the definitions for all high-level config and command directives. These
are excellent places to start with a top-to-bottom approach to understand
specific i3 behavior. For example, if you want to investigate a bug that happens
for the <code>move to mark</code> command, you can use gdb to pause in
<code>cmd_move_con_to_mark</code> and then work your way from there, stepping into
lower-level functions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/con.c</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains all functions which deal with containers directly (creating containers,
searching containers, getting specific properties from containers, …). Contains
abstractions and auxiliary functions necessary to work with the container
structure which is used in almost all parts of the codebase.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/tree.c</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains functions which deal with the tree abstraction. However, be aware that
<code>src/con.c</code> also contains functions that heavily interact with the tree
structure. Some functions that are included in <code>str/tree.c</code> are those that handle
opening and closing containers in the tree, finding the container that should be
focused next and flattening the tree. See also <code>src/move.c</code> for other
move-specific functions that interact with the tree, which were moved into their
own file because they are so long.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/workspace.c</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains functions which deal with workspaces. Includes code that creates new
workspaces, shows existing ones and deals with workspace assignments.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/handlers.c</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contains all handlers for all kinds of X events (new window title, new hints,
unmapping, key presses, button presses, …). This is a very important file to
understand how i3 interacts with changes to its environment.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/command_parser.c</dt>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/config_parser.c</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contain a hand-written parser to parse commands and configuration (commands are what
you bind on keys and what you can send to i3 using the IPC interface, like
<code>move left</code> or <code>workspace 4</code>). <code>src/config.c</code> is responsible for calling the
configuration parser.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/click.c</dt>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/resize.c</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contain functions which handle mouse button clicks (right mouse button
clicks initiate resizing and thus are relatively complex).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/manage.c</dt>
<dd>
<p>Looks at existing or new windows and decides whether to manage them. If so, it
reparents the window and inserts it into our data structures.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/match.c</dt>
<dd>
<p>A "match" is a data structure which acts like a mask or expression to match
certain windows or not. For example, when using commands, you can specify a
command like this: <code>[title="<strong>Firefox</strong>"] kill</code>. The title member of the match
data structure will then be filled and i3 will check each window using
<code>match_matches_window()</code> to find the windows affected by this command.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/randr.c</dt>
<dd>
<p>The RandR API is used to get (and re-query) the configured outputs (monitors,
…). Legacy Xinerama support resides in <code>src/xinerama.c</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/render.c</dt>
<dd>
<p>Renders the tree data structure by assigning coordinates to every node. These
values will later be pushed to X11 in <code>src/x.c</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/sighandler.c</dt>
<dd>
<p>Handles <code>SIGSEGV</code>, <code>SIGABRT</code> and <code>SIGFPE</code> by showing a dialog that i3 crashed.
You can choose to let it dump core and restart i3 in-place (either trying to
preserve layout or forget about it).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">src/window.c</dt>
<dd>
<p>Handlers to update X11 window properties like <code>WM_CLASS</code>, <code>_NET_WM_NAME</code>,
<code>CLIENT_LEADER</code>, etc.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">include/<strong>.xmacro.</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>A file containing all X11 atoms which i3 uses. This file will be included
various times (for defining, requesting and receiving the atoms), each time
with a different definition of xmacro().</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The data type is <code>Con</code>, in all cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_root_container">Root container</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The root container (global variable <code>croot</code>) is the up-most ascendant of every i3
container. It can be used to iterate over the whole tree structure. E.g., it is
used to reply to the <code>GET_WORKSPACES</code> request, iterating over it&#8217;s children to
find all workspaces. This is different from the X11 root window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The X11 root window (global variable <code>root</code>) is a single window per X11 display
(a display is identified by <code>:0</code> or <code>:1</code> etc.). The root window is what you draw
your background image on. It spans all the available outputs, e.g. <code>VGA1</code> is a
specific part of the root window and <code>LVDS1</code> is a specific part of the root
window.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_output_container">Output container</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every active output obtained through RandR is represented by one output
container. Outputs are considered active when a mode is configured (meaning
something is actually displayed on the output) and the output is not a clone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if your notebook has a screen resolution of 1280x800 px and you
connect a video projector with a resolution of 1024x768 px, set it up in clone
mode (<code>xrandr \--output VGA1 \--mode 1024x768 \--same-as LVDS1</code>), i3 will
reduce the resolution to the lowest common resolution and disable one of the
cloned outputs afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if you configure it using <code>xrandr \--output VGA1 \--mode 1024x768
\--right-of LVDS1</code>, i3 will set both outputs active. For each output, a new
workspace will be assigned. New workspaces are created on the output you are
currently on.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_content_container">Content container</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each output has multiple children. Two of them are dock containers which hold
the top and bottom dock clients. The other one is the content container, which
holds the actual content (workspaces) of this output.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_workspace">Workspace</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A workspace is identified by its name. Basically, you could think of
workspaces as different desks in your office, if you like the desktop
metaphor. They just contain different sets of windows and are completely
separate of each other. Other window managers also call this &#8220;Virtual
desktops&#8221;.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_split_container">Split container</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A split container is a container which holds an arbitrary amount of split
containers or X11 window containers. It has an orientation (horizontal or
vertical) and a layout.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Split containers (and X11 window containers, which are a subtype of split
containers) can have different border styles.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_leaf_containers">Leaf containers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A leaf container holds exactly one X11 window. They can&#8217;t have any children.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_listqueue_macros">List/queue macros</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>i3 makes heavy use of the list macros defined in BSD operating systems. To
ensure that the operating system on which i3 is compiled has all the expected
features, i3 comes with <code>include/queue.h</code>. On BSD systems, you can use <code>man
queue(3)</code>. On Linux, you have to use google (or read the source).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lists used are <code>SLIST</code> (single linked lists), <code>CIRCLEQ</code> (circular
queues) and <code>TAILQ</code> (tail queues). Usually, only forward traversal is necessary,
so an <code>SLIST</code> works fine. If inserting elements at arbitrary positions or at
the end of a list is necessary, a <code>TAILQ</code> is used instead. However, for the
windows inside a container, a <code>CIRCLEQ</code> is necessary to go from the currently

<h3 id="_grabbing_the_bindings">Grabbing the bindings</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Grabbing the bindings is quite straight-forward. You pass X your combination of
modifiers and the keycode you want to grab and whether you want to grab them
actively or passively. Most bindings (everything except for bindings using
Mode_switch) are grabbed passively, that is, just the window manager gets the
event and cannot replay it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We need to grab bindings that use Mode_switch actively because of a bug in X.
When the window manager receives the keypress/keyrelease event for an actively
grabbed keycode, it has to decide what to do with this event: It can either
replay it so that other applications get it or it can prevent other
applications from receiving it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, why do we need to grab keycodes actively? Because X does not set the
state-property of keypress/keyrelease events properly. The Mode_switch bit is
not set and we need to get it using XkbGetState. This means we cannot pass X
our combination of modifiers containing Mode_switch when grabbing the key and
therefore need to grab the keycode itself without any modifiers. This means,
if you bind Mode_switch + keycode 38 ("a"), i3 will grab keycode 38 ("a") and
check on each press of "a" if the Mode_switch bit is set using XKB. If yes, it
will handle the event, if not, it will replay the event.</p>

managed at all:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Windows have to be mapped, that is, visible on screen</p>

<p>Afterwards, i3 gets the initial geometry and reparents the window (see

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reparenting means that for each window which is reparented, a new window,
slightly larger than the original one, is created. The original window is then
reparented to the bigger one (called "frame").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After reparenting, the window type (<code>_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE</code>) is checked to see
whether this window is a dock (<code>_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK</code>), like dzen2 for
example. Docks are handled differently, they don’t have decorations and are not
assigned to a specific container. Instead, they are positioned at the bottom
or top of the screen (in the appropriate dock area containers). To get the
height which needs to be reserved for the window, the <code>_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL</code>
property is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, the list of assignments (to other workspaces, which may be on
other screens) is checked. If the window matches one of the user’s criteria,
it may either be put in floating mode or moved to a different workspace. If the
target workspace is not visible, the window will not be mapped.</p>

reparented (see section "Manage windows").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After reparenting the window, <code>render_tree()</code> is called which renders the
internal layout table. The new window has been placed in the currently focused
container and therefore the new window and the old windows (if any) need to be
moved/resized so that the currently active layout (default/stacking/tabbed mode)
is rendered correctly. To move/resize windows, a window is &#8220;configured&#8221; in
X11-speak.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some applications, such as MPlayer obviously assume the window manager is
stupid and try to configure their windows by themselves. This generates an
event called configurerequest. i3 handles these events and tells the window the

windows, which get configured like they want to, and floating windows, which

necessary centering for itself).</p>

<p>What <code>tree_render()</code> actually does is calling <code>render_con()</code> on the root

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rendering the root will first render all tiling windows and then all floating
windows. This is necessary because a floating window can be positioned in such
a way that it is visible on two different outputs. Therefore, by first
rendering all the tiling windows (of all outputs), we make sure that floating
windows can never be obscured by tiling windows.</p>

<p>In the configuration file and when using i3 interactively (with <code>i3-msg</code>, for
example), you use commands to make i3 do things, like focus a different window,
set a window to fullscreen, and so on. An example command is <code>floating enable</code>,
which enables floating mode for the currently focused window. See the
appropriate section in the <a href="userguide.html">User’s Guide</a> for a reference of
all commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In earlier versions of i3, interpreting these commands was done using lex and
yacc, but experience has shown that lex and yacc are not well suited for our
command language. Therefore, starting from version 4.2, we use a custom parser
for user commands and the configuration file.
The input specification for this parser can be found in the file
<code>parser-specs/*.spec</code>. Should you happen to use Vim as an editor, use
:source parser-specs/highlighting.vim to get syntax highlighting for this file

<h3 id="_using_cgroups_per_workspace">Using cgroups per workspace</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>cgroups (control groups) are a linux-only feature which provides the ability to
group multiple processes. For each group, you can individually set resource
limits, like allowed memory usage. Furthermore, and more importantly for our
purposes, they serve as a namespace, a label which you can attach to processes
and their children.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One interesting use for cgroups is having one cgroup per workspace (or
container, doesn’t really matter). That way, you could set different priorities
and have a workspace for important stuff (say, writing a LaTeX document or
programming) and a workspace for unimportant background stuff (say,
JDownloader). Both tasks can obviously consume a lot of I/O resources, but in
this example it doesn’t really matter if JDownloader unpacks the download a
minute earlier or not. However, your compiler should work as fast as possible.
Having one cgroup per workspace, you would assign more resources to the
programming workspace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another interesting feature is that an inherent problem of the workspace
concept could be solved by using cgroups: When starting an application on
workspace 1, then switching to workspace 2, you will get the application’s
window(s) on workspace 2 instead of the one you started it on. This is because
the window manager does not have any mapping between the process it starts (or
gets started in any way) and the window(s) which appear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine for example using dmenu: The user starts dmenu by pressing Mod+d, dmenu
gets started with PID 3390. The user then decides to launch Firefox, which
takes a long time. So they enter firefox into dmenu and press enter. Firefox
gets started with PID 4001. When it finally finishes loading, it creates an X11
window and uses MapWindow to make it visible. This is the first time i3
actually gets in touch with Firefox. It decides to map the window, but it has
no way of knowing that this window (even though it has the _NET_WM_PID property
set to 4001) belongs to the dmenu the user started before.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do cgroups help with this? Well, when pressing Mod+d to launch dmenu, i3
would create a new cgroup, let’s call it i3-3390-1. It launches dmenu in that
cgroup, which gets PID 3390. As before, the user enters firefox and Firefox
gets launched with PID 4001. This time, though, the Firefox process with PID
4001 is <strong>also</strong> member of the cgroup i3-3390-1 (because fork()ing in a cgroup
retains the cgroup property). Therefore, when mapping the window, i3 can look
up in which cgroup the process is and can establish a mapping between the
workspace and the window.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are multiple problems with this approach:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Every application has to properly set <code>_NET_WM_PID</code>. This is acceptable and
patches can be written for the few applications which don’t set the hint yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It does only work on Linux, since cgroups are a Linux-only feature. Again,
this is acceptable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main problem is that some applications create X11 windows completely
independent of UNIX processes. An example for this is Chromium (or
gnome-terminal), which, when being started a second time, communicates with
the first process and lets the first process open a new window. Therefore, if
you have a Chromium window on workspace 2 and you are currently working on
workspace 3, starting <code>chromium</code> does not lead to the desired result (the
window will open on workspace 2).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, my conclusion is that the only proper way of fixing the "window gets
opened on the wrong workspace" problem is in the application itself. Most
modern applications support freedesktop startup-notifications  which can be
used for this.</p>
